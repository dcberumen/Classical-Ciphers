To compile, simply, type ''make'' at the terminal (without the quotes).

– The programming language you use (e.g. C++, Java, Python)
    programming language: C++

– How to execute your program.
    ./cipher <cipher> <encrypt/decrypt> <key> <readfile> <outfile>

    <cipher>:
        -CES: Caesar cipher
        -PLF: Playfair cipher
        -RFC: Railfence cipher
        -RTS: RowTransposition cipher
        -VIG: Vigenere cipher

    <encrypt/decrypt>
        -e: encrypt
        -E: encrypt
        -d: decrypt
        -D: decrypt

    <key>
        Caesar: <int>
        Playfair: <string>
        Railfence: <int>
        RowTransposition: <string int>  ex. " 2 1 4 3 6 5": Numbers can only appear once and n > 0 string needs ""
        Vigenere: <string>

    <readfile>
        file to be read and encrypt/decrypt assumed .txt

    <outfile>
        filer to write encrypt/decrypt text assumed .txt

– Whether you implemented the extra credit.
    extra creadit:No

-extra information
    the playfair adds an "X" when needed
    the RowTransposition adds "X" when needed when decrypt the appended "X" if needed are at the end
